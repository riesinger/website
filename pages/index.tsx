                  I got into programming basic Windows Batch scripts in my early
                  teens and remember feeling thrilled when I created my first
                  number guessing game. Wanting to develop something more
                  advanced, I followed tutorials coding a simple side-scrolling{" "}

                  with Java 2D graphics. However, I quickly realized that
                  software-rendered graphics are too slow and therefore I
                  learned some{" "}

                  . Unfortunately, that project never was finished (you know how
                  it is üòâ).

                  During my last year of school, I worked for a small company
                  called SP Consulting and re-designed and their website, which
                  really got me into web development.

                  Between school and university, I started a project with 3 of
                  my friends which unfortunately ultimately failed. However,
                  I&apos;ve learned much from the project, including backend
                  programming in Go, database management and containerization
                  with Docker.

                  After school, I enrolled in a cooperative study program to get
                  my bachelor&apos;s in computer science. While studying at DHBW
                  Karlsruhe, I worked in multiple departments within SAP, both
                  as a frontend developer as well as a backend developer. Since
                  I finished my bachelor&apos;s degree in 2020, I&apos;m now a
                  full-time employee at SAP, mostly working on backend services
                  in Go and Kotlin.
