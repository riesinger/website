**Hi, I'm Pascal**, a software developer from Karlsruhe, Germany.

As you could imagine, I love playing around with all kinds of programming languages, patterns and
concepts. On top of that, I sometimes try to create or modify hardware devices.

Recently, one of my hobbies has been home automation and building little sensors for monitoring my
whole appartment.
This coincides with my urge to automate everything that takes more than 10 minutes.

I'm a strong proponent of free and open source software and online privacy and security.
