**Hi, I'm Pascal**, a student of computer science from Karlsruhe, Germany.

As you could imagine, I love playing around with all kinds of programming languages, patterns and
concepts. On top of that, I sometimes try to create or modify hardware devices.

I'm a strong proponent of free and open source software and online privacy and security.
