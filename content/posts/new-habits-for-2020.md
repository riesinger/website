I recently got into the topic of self-improvement a lot. I started watching videos of YouTubers like
[Matt D'Avella](https://www.youtube.com/user/blackboxfilmcompany). I think the reason I am into
these videos so much is that I would like to be more productive during my day. Procrastinating is
one of the only habits I currently have that I follow through every single day. 

Therefore, I decided it is time to try something new and build some new habits! After researching
the topic, 30 day habit-building periods seem to make the most sense. Here are the things I will try
to do the following months:

1. reading for at least 30 minutes each day
2. showering for less than 5 minutes 
3. no phone for the first hour after waking up
4. waking up at 5:30 am
5. meditating at least 30 minutes each day
6. go for a walk every day
7. stretch after waking up

The last habit I want to build during the next months is blogging more regularly. I have not put
that in the 30-day-challenge list, since I want to blog about building those habits as well as other
random thoughts more often, so I consider this my one-year-challenge.

Note that the list above is not necessarily in the order I will try to do these challenges. Also, I
might add one or two, If I feel like doing that. 
Expect to see some posts about the first challenge soonâ„¢ !
