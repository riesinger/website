I **love** offline media. I've always had issues with streaming services and linear television. For
example, you're watching a show, get to the third season and boom, the show is removed from Amazon
Prime, Netflix or your favorite service. And don't get me started with TV, where you have to adjust
your schedule around the program, if you want to watch a specific movie or follow a show.

So what's the solution? Keeping your media offline and hosting your own media server. Now, aside
from the effort of hosting the server (which is actually quite minimal), there's another issue:
storage space.

While a few Terabytes will be enough for your server in the beginning, once you start ripping
multiple series of a show, you'll see how quickly the episodes pile up. Now, buying additional hard
drives is always an option, but what if there's a cheaper way to fit some more shows onto your
server?

Let me introduce you to the world of *transcoding*.

## What is this "transcoding"?

The word transcoding describes itself quite well, if you split it into its two components: *trans*
and *coding*. Let's first explain *coding*. As you might have guessed, your movies and TV shows need
to be encoded into bits somehow to be stored on your hard drive. The instructions on how to code the
movie to bits and bytes and how to decode them again are called a **codec.** Now, the *trans* part
of transcoding is quite easy: You read the content of your media file with one codec and then
‚Äútransfer‚Äù or re-encode it with a different codec.

Since codecs evolve over time, it might make sense to transcode your media from time to time. Since
newer codecs usually should be more space-efficient, you could save quite a lot of space by doing
so. For example, after transcoding my library from various mixed codecs to H.265/HEVC, its size
shrunk from about 4.2TiB to about 3.1TiB, which roughly is a 25% reduction.

Also, having all your media files in one format just feels nice üòú

## Getting started with Unmanic

Now that you‚Äôre hopefully sold on the idea of transcoding your whole media library, you probably
think that that will be a huge endeavor. Let me introduce **Unmanic**, which is an amazing piece of
software created by [Josh Sunnex](https://github.com/Josh5). It basically allows you to transcode &
transform your whole library automatically by configuring your target state once and then just
letting it go ham on your files.

Before you start Unmanic, make sure your media is backed up. It should be anyway. I'm not responsible for any files you loose by following this post.

Since we‚Äôll want to use hardware transcoding, a GPU driver needs to be installed on your machine. Refer to your distributions‚Äô documentation on how to install VA-API support. Usually you‚Äôll just need the mesa drivers (on Debian, that‚Äôs just an `apt install mesa-va-drivers` away). Also install the package that provides the `vainfo` tool next (again, for Debian that‚Äôs `apt install vainfo`).
Once you run `sudo vainfo` you should receive an output similar to this one:

```yaml

error: XDG_RUNTIME_DIR not set in the environment.
error: can't connect to X server!
libva info: VA-API version 1.10.0
libva info: Trying to open /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/radeonsi_drv_video.so

vainfo: VA-API version: 1.10 (libva 2.10.0)
vainfo: Driver version: Mesa Gallium driver 20.3.5 for AMD Radeon(TM) Vega 8 Graphics (RAVEN, DRM 3.41.0, 5.13.19-3-pve, LLVM 11.0.1)

      VAProfileMPEG2Main              :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileVC1Simple              :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileVC1Main                :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileVC1Advanced            :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileH264ConstrainedBaseline:	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileH264ConstrainedBaseline:	VAEntrypointEncSlice
      VAProfileH264Main               :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileH264Main               :	VAEntrypointEncSlice
      VAProfileH264High               :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileH264High               :	VAEntrypointEncSlice
      VAProfileHEVCMain               :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileHEVCMain               :	VAEntrypointEncSlice
      VAProfileHEVCMain10             :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileJPEGBaseline           :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileVP9Profile0            :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileVP9Profile2            :	VAEntrypointVLD
      VAProfileNone                   :	VAEntrypointVideoProc

```

Your output will vary based on your GPU and the codecs it supports. What‚Äôs important is that it supports the `VAProfileHEVCMain`. That‚Äôs the profile used to decode & encode HEVC/H.265 video.

Now, since Unmanic is distributed in a Docker container, getting started with it is rather simple.
Assuming you use `docker-compose` (or `docker compose`) ‚Äî and you really should, if you're not ‚Äî you can use this `docker-compose.yaml` for starting your very own instance of Unmanic:

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  unmanic:
    image: "josh5/unmanic"
    env:
      PUID: "1000"
      PGID: "1000"
    volumes:
      - unmanic:/config
      - /path/to/your/media/:/library
      - /path/to/a/fast/disk/:/tmp/unmanic
    devices:
      - /dev/dri/:/dev/dri
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 8888:8888

volumes:
  unmanic:

```

You'll need to modify two of the volumes in the example however. The one in line 11 should link your media folder to `/library` inside the container. In case you store movies and shows on different paths, you can just add multiple volumes and link them to directories inside `/library`, like `/library/movies`. The volume defined in line 12 is for a fast transcode cache. It should have space for your largest media files multiplied by the amount of workers you're going to choose (typically not more than 3) and should preferably reside on an SSD, but at least on some different HDDs than your main media storage. Unmanic will write the output files to this location and them move them back to your library (it cannot read and write the source media files at the same time, obviously).

If you now head to your server's IP address on port `8888` in your browser, you should see the
Unmanic dashboard, like shown in the screenshot above (obviously without any data in it).

Now, open the ‚Äúhamburger‚Äù menu on the left of your screen and jump into the settings. There will be four main sections of which the first three are relevant for us. Under **Library** you can configure settings related to your media library. You‚Äôll need to configure your library path to be at `/library`, if you‚Äôre using the `docker-compose.yaml` file I provided. The rest of the settings can be left on their default value or configured by you, depending on your needs. These will configure how often Unmanic will scan for new media files. Make sure to make liberal use of the *Submit* button at the bottom of the settings page. Otherwise your changes won‚Äôt be persisted.

On the **Workers** page you can configure the number of workers for simultaneous transcoding of multiple files. There‚Äôs no silver bullet here, you‚Äôll need to find out what works best on your machine on your own. Note that more workers aren‚Äôt necessarily better. I‚Äôve found 2-3 workers to be optimal in *my* case, but this depends on the speed of your media storage, your cache, your CPU and GPU, so for a start, you can just leave it as it is.

The **Plugins** section is where you configure how you‚Äôd like your media to be encoded. Every processing step in Unmanic is implemented as a plugin, so there are ones for handling video transcoding, audio transcoding, subtitle removal and other post-processing steps. Head to the section and click the ‚ÄúAdd new‚Äù button. Use the search bar to search for  `hevc_vaapi` and download the ‚ÄúVideo Encoder H265/HEVC - hevc_vaapi (INTEL/AMD)‚Äù plugin.

Close the plugin chooser pane and select the plugin, then enable it from the options menu.

Next, we‚Äôll need to configure your desired video quality, as the default might be really bad (it was on my GPU+driver combo). To do that, just click the button next to the checkbox, which will open a ‚Äúplugin info‚Äù panel. Head to options settings, tick the boxes that say ‚ÄúEnable VAAPI HW Accelerated Decoding?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWrite your own FFmpeg params‚Äù. Now you can pass a quality option to the ‚ÄúWrite your own custom video options‚Äù box.  I chose `qp:v 21` . The 21 is roughly equivalent with the values you‚Äôd pass to the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) when encoding normally with `ffmpeg` . You‚Äôll need to find you sweet spot though experimentation though. Lower values should yield better quality but typically increase file size.

Once you configured your plugin, you‚Äôre pretty much set! Head back to the home-page and re-enable the workers from the ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù menu in the worker pane. If you want to force Unmanic to re-scan your library, you can do that by maximizing the ‚ÄúPending Tasks‚Äù pane and then selecting the ‚ÄúRescan library now‚Äù option from it‚Äôs ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù menu.
