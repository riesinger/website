NoNonsense.cooking is a website hosting my favorite recipes. I needed a way to share recipes with friends and family and didn't like existing (German) sites, since they were usually bloated, looked outdated or had a huge amount of trackers. That's why I built NoNonsense.cooking. It's open source and anyone can contribute recipes on GitHub.

## Personal development

NoNonsense.cooking was my first proper Next.JS project. I learned a lot about its inner workings and started to enjoy webapps with it a lot. It provides many useful things, such as server-side rendering, out of the box, which made creating NoNonsense.cooking quick and easy. Creating NoNonsense.cooking has also taught me the importance of backgrounds in photography. Make it to empty and the photo looks bland, add too many things and it looks crowded.
